# RICHTER COMPETITION
DrivenData is a website that hosts data science competitions focused on having a real-world impact. Using the CRISP-DM methodology, I worked on the "Richter's Predictor" competition. The goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. 

## 1. Business Understanding
Earthquakes may not happen frequently, however their consequences can be catastrophic. So based on this data, the goal is to identify which buildings are prone to be damaged in other places, in case another earquakes happens. The objective was to develop a model to predict the kind of damage for each building.
